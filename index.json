It serves around 5 or 6 people, and takes just 15 - 20 minutes of active baking time (just over an hour total time).\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need: # 180g flour (sifted) 180g caster (or granulated) sugar 4 medium eggs (3 if using large eggs) 100 ml milk 180g butter 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp vanilla extract A pinch of salt Recipe: # Prep: # First, beat the eggs while slowly adding sugar. Do this for around 5 minutes until it changes colour from yellow to white, and its volume increases around 2-3 times.\nMix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Then add this mixture to the egg and sugar batter you made previously.\nTip: Add in 3 lots, mixing for just a few seconds (less than 10) on a low speed in between. This is to make it so that the flour is just incorporated, and the air bubbles that were made in step 1 should, for the most part, remain. (it\u0026rsquo;s alright if there are small bits left) Add milk and butter to a saucepan or a microwavable container. Then heat them up (slowly) and mix them. This is because, weirdly, hot milk helps with aeration.\nMix a little bit of the batter into the hot milk. This serves two purposes, A) to bring down the temperature so that the milk wont \u0026ldquo;cook\u0026rdquo; the eggs B) reduces the density of the milk, so it blends faster with the rest of the batter.\nRemember: continue blending minimally so you can keep the air bubbles you made in step 1. Slowly pour the milk mixture into the batter (and also add the vanilla extract here) for 20 seconds on a low speed for around 20 seconds. At this point, the batter should be smooth.\nPour the batter into a cake pan(s) lined with baking paper or grease the pan(s) with butter.\nKnock the big air bubbles by \u0026lsquo;dropping\u0026rsquo; the pan on the counter 3 times. By this you wont get rid of the cake-raising bubbles introduced in step 1, but you will get rid of unsightly air bubbles in the surface.\nBake for around 30 - 45 mins\nPost-baking # If you wish to have level cakes (for things such as layered cakes), cool the cakes upside down on a cooling rack; store upright for a pretty, golden-brown dome on top And there it is, soft and delicious vanilla cake. Of course while it is prefectly acceptable to eat it as-is, I would recommend adding something like a chocolate ganache, frosting, buttercream, or something else of the sort to add some pizzaz to the cake.\nCredits go to Nagi at recipe tin eats\n","date":"12 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/vanilla-cake/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Vanilla Cake Recipe!","title":"Vanilla Cake"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
