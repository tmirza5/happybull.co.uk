# Omnime
Enjoy and manage animanga from a beautiful CLI.

## What `Omnime` will do:
- Scrape Anime
- Scrape Manga and Light Novels
- Manage an Anime Watchlist
- Manage a Manga/Light Novel Readlist

## What makes `Omnime` different from the rest?
We believe that good software should be efficient and good-looking. Therefore `Omnime` is to be programmed in Go, and built on top of the [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) library.<br>
We also believe in the simplicity and ease of the end-user, so there will be many features for you to enjoy, all easily accessible.

## When should you expect to be able to use `Omnime`?
`Omnime` should be fully functional by `November 2024` (although this date is not set in stone).
